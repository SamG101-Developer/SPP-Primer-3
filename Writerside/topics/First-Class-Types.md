# First Class Types

Every type in S++ is first class. This includes arrays, tuples, variants, functions, numbers, booleans, void and
strings. This means that they can be passed as arguments, returned from functions, stored in variables, and so on. It
also means that there is no special behaviour for objects that use these types. This contrasts with languages like C++,
where objects are treated differently to primitive types.
