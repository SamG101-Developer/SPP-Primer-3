# Concurrency

<primary-label ref="header-label"/>

<secondary-label ref="doc-complete"/>

S++ uses coroutines as the primary concurrency mechanism. They can be suspended and resumed, and support bidirectional
data flow between the caller and the coroutine. They are defined in the same way as a function or method, but they
require the `cor` keyword rather than `fun`.

Coroutine return types are constrained to generators or borrows, as explored below. Typically, there will be `gen`
expressions inside the coroutine, to generate or yield values to the caller. Assigning a value from the `gen` expression
allows data back into the function on resuming (for generators).

## Coroutine Return Types

<secondary-label ref="doc-sect-complete"/>

<secondary-label ref="feature-wip"/>

There are 3 generator types in S++:

- `GenMov[Gen, Send=Void]`: Moves the value out of the generator.
- `GenMut[Gen, Send=Void]`: Mutably borrows the value from the generator.
- `GenRef[Gen, Send=Void]`: Immutably borrows the value from the generator.

| Generator Evaluation    | Generated Value    |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| `GenMov[T]::step(Send)` | `T or None`        |
| `GenMut[T]::step(Send)` | `&mut (T or None)` |
| `GenRef[T]::step(Send)` | `& (T or None)`    |

There are 2 runtime borrow types in S++:

- `BorrowMut[Gen]`: Mutably borrows a value from the coroutine.
- `BorrowRef[Gen]`: Immutably borrows a value from the coroutine.

| Borrow Type    | Caller Interaction |
|----------------|--------------------|
| `BorrowMut[T]` | `&mut T`           |
| `BorrowRef[T]` | `& T`              |

### Generator Types

<secondary-label ref="feature-impl"/>

Each generator type corresponds to the convention on the `gen` expression. For example, if values are generated with
`gen &mut value`, then the `GenMut` type is used as the return value. All values being generated must use the same
convention, and generate the same type.

The `Gen` generic parameter represents the type being generated. The return type `GenMov[Gen=BigInt]` means that big
integers are being generated and moved: `gen 123`. This means that both the expression type and expression convention
are represented in the return type.

The `Send` generic parameter represents the type being sent back to the coroutine. This defaults to `Void`, disallowing
data to be sent back (cannot have a `Void` variable), but can be set to any type. Only owned objects can be sent back
into a coroutine.

### Borrow Types

<secondary-label ref="feature-not-impl-yet"/>

The `BorrowXXX` types are private to the STL, and can only be used by using the `RefSlot` type. This forces all runtime
borrows to adhere to memory mutability exclusivity checks. The point of these borrow types is to skip boilerplate code
found in generators, when there is only going to be 1 value:

Instead of having to write the following for every `RefSlot` access:

```
let generator = value.borrow_ref()
let value = generator.step()
...
generator.step()
```

The `BorrowXXX` types allow for a more concise syntax:

```
let value = value.borrow_ref()
```

In the background, the compiler interprets the coroutine return type as a generator, and automatically steps the value
into the variable. The destructor of the borrow type drops the borrow, invalidating the generator, and decrementing the
count in the corresponding `RefSlot`. This allows inner scopes to be created to manage runtime-generated borrow
lifetimes.

## Advancing a Generator

<secondary-label ref="doc-sect-complete"/>

<secondary-label ref="feature-not-impl-yet"/>

A generator is advanced by using the `.step()` method. As this requires compiler specific code to invalidate the
previously yielded borrow, `step` is a callable postfix keyword, rather than a method.

```
cor coroutine(a: BigInt, b: BigInt, c: BigInt) -> GenRef[Gen=BigInt] {
    gen &a
    gen &b
    gen &c
}

fun main() -> Void {
    let generator = coroutine(1, 2, 3)
    let a = generator.step()
    let b = generator.step()  # invalidates "a"
    let c = generator.step()  # invalidates "b"
}
```

Invalidating is done by assignment or variable definition statements marking their left-hand-side symbolic value as
borrow-bound to the generator rhs (check the postfix expression type for the `.step` postfix operation), and the
generator is subsequently advanced.

For `BorrowXXX` types, the `step` keyword is not applicable, and an error will be thrown if it is used. Instead, the
generator is advanced by the compiler, and the borrow is dropped when the variable goes out of scope.

## Passing Data Out of a Coroutine

<secondary-label ref="doc-sect-complete"/>

<secondary-label ref="feature-impl"/>

As seen above, data is passed out of a coroutine using the `gen` expression, including an optional convention. Allowing
borrows to be yielded from coroutines is the basis for iteration, as it allows elements of a vector, for example, to be
borrowed and used in the caller.

If the `Gen` argument is `Void`, then the generator type must be `GenMov[Gen=Void]`, because borrows cannot be taken
from nothing, ie `gen` is valid on its own, but `gen &mut` doesn't make sense without a value to borrow.

```
cor coroutine(a: BigInt, b: BigInt, c: BigInt) -> GenRef[Gen=BigInt] {
    gen &a
    gen &b
    gen &c
}
```

### Invalidating Borrows

<secondary-label ref="doc-sect-complete"/>

<secondary-label ref="feature-impl"/>

When borrowed values are yielded from a coroutine, they are only valid until the next `step()` call is made to the
coroutine. This is to ensure they remain valid for the coroutine to use in steps up to the next yield.

```
cor coroutine(a: BigInt, b: BigInt, c: BigInt) -> GenRef[Gen=BigInt] {
    gen &a
    
    let s = a + b
    gen &s
}

fun main() -> Void {
    let generator = coroutine(1, 2, 3)
    let a = generator.step()
    let b = generator.step()  # invalidates "a"
    let c = generator.step()  # invalidates "b"
}
```

In this example it can be seen that `a` is consumed in the coroutine. As there is no guarantee whether a variable is
consumed or not in the coroutine after being yielded as a borrow, it must be assumed that a worst-cast scenario occurs,
and that every variable yielded as a borrow might subsequently be consumed. As such, every time another borrowed value
is yielded, the previous borrow will be invalidated in the caller.

## Passing Data Into a Coroutine

<secondary-label ref="doc-sect-complete"/>

<secondary-label ref="feature-impl"/>

The `.step()` method takes a single argument, whose type matches the `Send` generic parameter of the generator (
coroutine return type). Because substituting `Void` as a generic parameter causes function parameters of that type to be
removed from the signature, `.step()` can be used for th default `Send=Void` generic parameter.

Values are received by placing the `gen` expression on the right-hand-side of a variable definition statement. Variables
are always moved into a coroutine, not borrowed. This means that receiving a second value into the coroutine doesn't
invalidate the first one.

```
cor coroutine() -> GenMov[Gen=BigInt, Send=BigInt] {
    let a = gen 1
    let b = gen 2
    let c = gen 3
    gen a + b + c
}

fun main() -> Void {
    let generator = coroutine()
    let a = generator.step(1)
    let b = generator.step(2)
    let c = generator.step(3)
    let t = generator.step(0)
}
```

## Borrowing Data Into a Coroutine

<secondary-label ref="doc-sect-complete"/>

<secondary-label ref="feature-impl"/>

A problem is presented when trying to use borrows with coroutines; a borrow could be passed into a coroutine, the
coroutine suspends, the owned object in the caller context is consumed, and the borrow is subsequently used in the
coroutine. In order to prevent this, memory pinning is used.

All borrows into a coroutine must be pinned. This prevents them from being consumed in the caller context, until they
are manually released. Releasing a pin will invalidate any object relying on the pin. Therefore, if a coroutine received
a borrow, and the memory of that borrow is released, the coroutine is marked as consumed and is non-usable.

## Chaining Coroutines

<secondary-label ref="doc-sect-complete"/>

<secondary-label ref="feature-wip"/>

Coroutine chaining allows a coroutine to yield the entirety of another coroutine in a one-line expression; without a
loop. This is identical to Pythons `yield from` statement. In S++, `gen with` is used, to generate values with another
coroutine.

The following example shows equivalent code using a loop and coroutine chaining:

```
cor coroutine() -> GenMov[Gen=BigInt] {
    gen 1
    gen 2
    gen 3
}

cor coroutine_chain() -> GenMov[Gen=BigInt] {
    gen 0
    for i in coroutine() {
        gen i
    }
}
```

```
cor coroutine() -> GenMov[Gen=BigInt] {
    gen 1
    gen 2
    gen 3
}

cor coroutine_chain() -> GenMov[Gen=BigInt] {
    gen 0
    gen with coroutine()
}
```
